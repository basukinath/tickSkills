CodePrepCodePrep is a web platform designed to help users prepare for programming interviews and upskill their coding abilities. It provides a variety of coding questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), brain teasers, and progress tracking to enhance learning and problem-solving skills.FeaturesCoding Challenges: Solve a wide range of coding problems with varying difficulty levels to sharpen algorithmic and problem-solving skills.
Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs): Test theoretical knowledge with MCQs covering data structures, algorithms, and core programming concepts.
Brain Teasers: Engage with logic-based puzzles to improve critical thinking and problem-solving.
Progress Tracking: Monitor your learning journey with personalized dashboards, performance analytics, and progress reports.
User Authentication: Secure user accounts with role-based access control and authentication using Spring Security.
Scalable Architecture: Built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for robust, scalable, and distributed system design.
Containerization: Deployed using Docker for consistent and portable environments.

Tech StackBackend: Spring Boot (Core framework for RESTful APIs)
Spring Cloud (Microservices and distributed system support)
Spring Security (Authentication and authorization)
Spring Data JPA (Database interactions)

Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL (Relational database for user data, questions, and progress)
Redis (Optional for caching and session management)

Frontend: React.js (Interactive and dynamic UI)
Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap (Styling and responsive design)

Containerization & Deployment:Docker (Containerization for consistent environments)
Docker Compose/Kubernetes (Orchestration for multi-container setups)

Other Tools:Maven/Gradle (Dependency management)
Git (Version control)
JUnit (Testing)
Swagger (API documentation)

Git

InstallationClone the Repository:bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodePrep.git
cd CodePrep

Backend Setup:Configure database settings in src/main/resources/application.properties.
Build the project:bash

mvn clean install

Run the Spring Boot application:bash

mvn spring-boot:run

Frontend Setup:Navigate to the frontend directory:bash

cd frontend

Install dependencies:bash

npm install

Start the development server:bash

npm start

Docker Setup:Build and run the application using Docker Compose:bash

docker-compose up --build

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

ConfigurationDatabase: Update application.properties with your database credentials:properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/codeprep
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

Spring Security: Configure user roles and authentication in security/SecurityConfig.java.
Spring Cloud: Set up service discovery, load balancing, or API gateway if using microservices (e.g., Eureka, Spring Cloud Gateway).

API EndpointsPOST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate and generate JWT token.
GET /api/questions/coding: Fetch coding questions.
POST /api/questions/submit: Submit code for evaluation.
GET /api/mcqs: Retrieve MCQs.
GET /api/progress: View user progress and analytics.

(Full API documentation available via Swagger at /swagger-ui/.)DeploymentLocal Deployment: Use Docker Compose for local testing.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy on AWS, Azure, or GCP using Kubernetes for orchestration.
Ensure environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret) are set in your deployment configuration.
